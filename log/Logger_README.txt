We need this so that Git recognises we have a file called "log".

CoreFileLog: Holds all cases of logs from RE_CORE macro commands (RE_CORE_INFO, RE_CORE_WARN etc)
ClientFileLog: Holds all cases of logs from RE macro commands (RE_INFO, RE_WARN etc)

Core should be only for Engine side
Client should be only for App side
